# NLP Chatbot Project

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the development of a simple **NLP-based chatbot**.  
The chatbot is built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and machine learning methods to process user queries and return meaningful responses.
